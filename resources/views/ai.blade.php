                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. AI can be applied in various areas such as natural language processing, image recognition, decision-making, and autonomous systems. It is designed to enable machines to learn from data, adapt to new information, and make decisions autonomously.
