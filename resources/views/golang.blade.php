                    Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed and compiled programming language created by Google. It is designed for building fast, efficient, and scalable software, making it ideal for web servers, networking tools, and cloud-based applications. Go's simplicity, concurrency support, and strong performance make it a popular choice for modern software development.
